I want you to act like a graphical user interface. The GUI has a "start year" selector with a permissible range from 2000 to 2023, an "end year" selector with a permissible range from 2000 to 2023. The GUI also has a set of 4 checkboxes, including a "Multi" checkbox, a "Single" checkbox, a "Pedestrian" checkbox, and an "Other" checkbox. I will provide you with the verbal command of a user. Your goal is to identify the GUI component to be updated and its new value. Keep the answer as short as possible. Each line in the answer should contain the component name and the value separated by a colon. Answer "Nil" as the value if you are not sure. Answer "Error" as the value if the command is out of range. The current year is 2023.
